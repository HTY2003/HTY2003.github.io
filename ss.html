            <p>Nowadays, in Singapore, foreign labour can be seen along all walks of life. Ever since the 1980s, there has been an increasingly large influx of immigrants travelling into Singapore to work. These foreigners have greatly benefited Singapore’s economy and development, building our HDBs and managing our businesses. </p>

            <p>However, many Singaporeans have spoken against immigration, spreading xenophobic sentiments among the people. These thoughts haven’t emerged in the majority of the public, or created a nation-wide civil war, but the danger of xenophobia is still very much present, ready to emerge any time.</p>

            <p>To begin explaining the discrimination towards immigrants and foreign labour in Singapore, we need to discover the causes of the large influx of immigrants into Singapore.</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Liberal Immigration Policies</h2>

            <p>In the 1980s, Singapore was experiencing a severe lack of natural growth within the local population. Furthermore, there were more elderly for the dependents to take care, not to mention a need for more manpower to power factories in labour-intensive industries.</p>

            <p>In order to counteract the low natural birth rate and need for low-skill labour to take up jobs and fuel industries, the government adopted more liberal policies such that immigrants would find it easier to live and work in the country.</p>

            <p>In saying this, I refer to how Singapore does not have many restrictions or requirements for immigrants besides a work permit, making immigration policies here relatively open-door. </p>

            <p>Unlike countries like Japan and the UK, which heavily discourage immigration by placing restrictions and limiting the number of immigrants, Singapore is much easier to enter for jobs, incentivising foreigners to migrate here.</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Economic Opportunities</h2>

            <p>In addition, there are many job opportunities in Singapore, due to the high volume of businesses and corporations here. </p>
            
            <p> Multinational corporations(MNCs) like Apple and McDonald’s are attracted by our high political stability, with Singapore being the 7th least corrupt nation in the world, as well as our transparency in transactions, ease of doing business, and well-established judiciary system. </p>
            
            <p>Over 7000 MNCs have set up businesses and operations across the island, creating job opportunities and a reputation for Singapore as a business hub. </p>
            
            <p>From higher-skill intensive industries like electronics and healthcare to labour-intensive industries like construction, there are a high amount of jobs readily available for immigrants to take up, adding to the incentive of immigrating to Singapore to work.</p>

            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Large Influx of Immigrants</h2>
            
            <p>To say that the number of immigrants that came to Singapore as a result of this was huge would be an understatement. By the 1990s, immigration in Singapore exceeded the natural growth of the population, accounting for two-thirds of the population increase. </p>
            
            <p>Since 2000, the number of foreign workers and their relative impact on society has been increasing steadily. For example, the percentage of foreigners in Singapore’s total labour force increased from 28.1% in 2000 to 34.7% in 2010.  As of June 2014, the foreign population of Singapore, consisting of permanent residents(PRs) as well as non-residents with work visas, and foreign students, took up 38.9% of Singapore’s total population of 5.47 million. </p>
            
            <p>Clearly, foreign immigrants staying in Singapore play a large role in Singaporean society, a role that gets larger each year as they take up more of the population and workforce.</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Resultant Social Issues</h2>

            <p>But with this influx, it was inevitable for problems to arise from this massive influx of foreign labour. While more immigration helped the economy, the government’s open-door immigration policies have sparked backlash from the locals towards these foreign workers. </p>
           
            <p>Immigrants have come under fire for many social issues, such as overcrowding, suppressing wages, and increased competition against locals for jobs and income.</p>
            
            <p>Most foreign workers do not blend in well physically with Singaporeans, with various accents and features. </p>
            
            <p>In addition, the majority of foreign workers in Singapore working in the domestic services or construction industries. This places them in the bottom 10% of Singapore’s population in terms of income, and also leads to them working and living under poor conditions. </p>
           
            <p>With so many cultural, racial, and socio-economic differences between the two groups, the biases and prejudices between the two groups are widening, amplifying the negative perceptions of the social issues listed below.</p>
           
            <h6 class="section-heading">Competition For Jobs</h6>
            
            <p>Since the baseline salary for foreign workers in Singapore of $1200 per month is lower than that which most post-graduates would like to earn, many see foreign workers as competitors for job opportunities.</p> 
           
            <p>Some even despise the foreign workers due to them being willing to do the same work as them for less wages, causing the locals to find it harder to get jobs and raise their salaries.</p> 
          
            <h6 class="section-heading">Questioning National Identity</h6>
            
            <p>When a significant portion of the population come from other countries, it is harder for the locals to defend the local values and norms that result from a life spent in Singapore.</p>

	    <p>Even slang like Singlish can lose some of its significance, when not everyone in Singapore can speak it. Being more disconnected from the lifestyle and ethos of Singaporean citizenship, immigration tends to raise questions about national identity.</p>

            <p>Witnessing the government’s focus on productivity and development through immigration, the locals question whether the focus of the Singaporean identity is truly national values and culture.</p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Xenophobic Sentiments Spreading</h2>
		  
	    <p>Hence, the discontent caused by these social issues grows.</p> 
		  
            <p>One major example of this miscommunication and prejudices can be observed in the Little India Riots on 8 December 2013, where a foreign Indian construction worker, was hit and killed by a private bus along the roads of Little India. This accident grew in an unruly crowd of over 300 immigrants rioting along Little India, damaging several vehicles and even injuring some aggressors.</p> 
            
	    <p>From this incident, unprecedented in over 40 years, the prejudices and underlying hatred between foreign workers and immigrants were highlighted, and these sentiments were spread even more to the public.</p> 
            
	    <h2 class="section-heading">Finding solutions</h2>
		  
            <p>In the 2011 National Day Rally’s Prime Minister’s Speech, Prime Minister Mr. Lee Hsien Loong admitted that “managing the inflow of foreign workers and immigrants” would take time to accomplish, since it was a complicated issue. </p> 
            
	    <p>He stated that a balance had to be struck, since immigrants would still be integral to Singapore’s economy rising, even despite “Singaporeans [worrying] about competition from foreigners” in both education and the workforce. </p>

	    <p>Hence, I propose two solutions to fix the problem of discrimination and prejudice towards foreign workers in Singapore.</p>
